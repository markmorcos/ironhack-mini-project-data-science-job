## Hypothesis

1. Jobs in specialized categories (e.g., Machine Learning, AI) offer higher salaries than general data science roles.
2. Full-time roles offer higher salaries than part-time, contract, or freelance positions.
3. Remote positions offer higher salaries compared to in-person or hybrid roles.
4. Today, it may be more beneficial for companies to relocate their data teams to countries with lower salary costs or to hire employees remotely. 

## Analysis Overview

- **Some Jobs Category offer higher salaries**
	- There are very small differences between salaries, when it comes to Data Science, Analysis, ML/AI or Engineering jobs
- **Full-time roles offer higher salaries**
	- Our hypothesis that full-time roles offer higher salaries than part-time, contract, or freelance positions was proven wrong, the highest average salary was in part-time, then freelance and full-time jobs.
- **Remote position offer higher salaries**
	- Remote roles do not offer the highest salaries.
- **Benefit of companies that employ their team in other countries**
	- it is indeed more cost-effective for companies to hire remote employees, as it allows them to reduce salary expenses while accessing a broader talent pool.


## Conclusion

The analysis reveals that some job categories offer higher salaries, with only slight differences noted among Data Science, Analysis, ML/AI, and Engineering roles. Contrary to the initial hypothesis, part-time positions have the highest average salaries, followed by freelance and then full-time roles. Remote roles do not offer the highest salaries. Companies employing remote teams in other countries benefit from cost savings and access to a wider talent pool.
